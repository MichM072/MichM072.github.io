# Who am I?

Hello, I am Michael Moor. I am a student at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and currently do a bachelor Artificial Intelligence with the Intelligent Systems track. My study focusses on the use of artificial intelligence and how to program said AI. I personally enjoy this study as the future of AI intrigues me, it is constantly growing and playing a more prominent role in all of our lives. I am looking forward to seeing how I can implement AI to help society. My strengths are teamwork, reasoning, persistence, planning, analyzing and problem-solving. I am currently also a Teaching Assistant at the Vrije Universiteit for the course Intelligent Systems.
